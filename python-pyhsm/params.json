{"name":"Python-pyhsm","tagline":"Python code for YubiHSM","body":"This is the Python package to talk to a YubiHSM.\r\n\r\nThe YubiHSM is Yubico's take on the Hardware Security Module (HSM),\r\ndesigned for protecting secrets on authentication servers, including\r\ncryptographic keys and passwords, at unmatched simplicity and low\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nSee the files in utils/, examples/ yhsm-val/, and yubikey-ksm/ to get\r\nan idea of how to use this code.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Yubico AB\r\nSee the file COPYING for licence statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n================\r\n  Introduction\r\n================\r\n\r\npyhsm aims to be a reference implementation implementing all the\r\nfunctions available in the YubiHSM. The base version number of pyhsm\r\nwill match the supported hardware version of the YubiHSM (e.g. 0.9.8,\r\n0.9.8a, 0.9.8b all intended to be used with hardware version 0.9.8).\r\n\r\npyhsm also includes the regression test suite for the YubiHSM.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the YubiHSM communication library, pyhsm also contains\r\nsome applications utilizing the YubiHSM :\r\n\r\n  * yhsm-val    - a simple validation server supporting validation of\r\n                  YubiKey OTPs, OATH codes and password hashes.\r\n  * yubikey-ksm - ykval YubiKey OTP decryption backend using the\r\n                  YubiHSM.\r\n\r\nand some smaller scripts in the utils/ and examples/ directory :\r\n\r\n  * yhsm-linux-add-entropy\r\n                - Feed Linux kernel with random entropy from the TRNG\r\n\t\t  on the YubiHSM.\r\n  * yhsm-keystore-unlock\r\n\t\t- Unlock the key storage in the YubiHSM with your HSM\r\n\t\t  password. Use with incorrect password to lock it again.\r\n  * yhsm-sysinfo.py\r\n\t\t- Print basic system information about the connected\r\n\t\t  YubiHSM.\r\n  * yhsm-monitor-exit.py\r\n\t\t- Get a YubiHSM *in debug mode* to enter configuration\r\n\t\t  mode again, without having to press the little button\r\n\t\t  while inserting it into the USB port.\r\n  * yhsm-password-auth.py\r\n\t\t- Example of how to turn passwords (or hashes of\r\n\t\t  passwords if you like PBKDF2) into AEADs that can be\r\n\t\t  used to verify the password later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n================\r\n  Installation\r\n================\r\n\r\npyhsm is known to work with Python 2.6 and 2.7.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you want to use any of the daemons (yhsm-validation-server,\r\nyhsm-yubikey-ksm) you will want to use Python 2.7 or later.\r\nSocketServer.py lacks critical timeout handling in Python 2.6.\r\n\r\nIt is primarily tested using Debian/Ubuntu, but is of course\r\nmeant to work on as many platforms as possible.\r\n\r\npyhsm is installable in the standard-python way :\r\n\r\n  $ cd pyhsm-$ver\r\n  $ python setup.py install\r\n\r\nThis requires the python-setuptools (well, the package is called\r\nthat in Debian/Ubuntu).\r\n\r\nYou will also need the pyserial package (python-serial in\r\nDebian/Ubuntu) from http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/ and, to run\r\nthe test suite, pycrypto from http://www.pycrypto.org/\r\n(python-crypto in Debian/Ubuntu).\r\n\r\nI use Ubuntu, so I created a PPA (Personal Package Archive) for\r\neasy installation (and removal) on Ubuntu systems.\r\n\r\nIf you use a recent Ubuntu release, you should be able to install\r\npython-pyhsm with these commands :\r\n\r\n  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fredrikt/yubico\r\n  $ sudo apt-get update\r\n  $ sudo apt-get install python-pyhsm\r\n\r\nThe Launchpad PPA key generated for my packages is C7E50642.\r\n\r\nIf you want to work on Debian/Ubuntu packaging, or just build packages\r\ndirectly from version controlled sources, you can find it maintained\r\nin a git repository.\r\n\r\n  $ git clone git://github.com/Yubico/python-pyhsm-dpkg.git\r\n  $ cd python-pyhsm-dpkg\r\n  $ git-buildpackage\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/Yubico/python-pyhsm-dpkg for more information.\r\n\r\n================\r\n\r\nComments, feedback and patches welcome!\r\n\r\nFredrik Thulin <fredrik@yubico.com> 2011-03-28\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
